## Instructions
1. Clone this repo
2. Go to the root of your local clone of this repo
3. In the project root, create a file called `.accounts.json` with a JSON array of accounts, e.g.:
```json
[
	"rdx1qsp05ckm5zvngyp42m8wvehf8y0jwax4h66sfgj88g8frxa8pctk55ck2emx6",
	"rdx1qspsgtz8wxzhs7h3m5dxz4uw0a350qp567zz4v9xgamcag8kavsxvpctcgge2",
	"rdx1qspym2zqgl5m723jlj5j442p6dkzhqs3prkzpfryl3dp2mpaqx8m0dgqc9sps",
	"rdx1qspxjlfeyelv4sz674ymplk2dhx43zr9qva03u2c72xsus4wnn8y3psefg37d"
]
```
4. Run: `swift run`

Optionally you can also add another accounts list, on the same format, with the name `.accounts_legacy.json` if you have migrated from on older wallet, that you might wanna continue to monitor.
